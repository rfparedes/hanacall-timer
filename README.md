<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

hanacall-timer was developed so that users can see how long HANA_CALL's from the resource agent to HANA take to return. This can be used to confirm the HANA_CALL's are returning in a timely manner and to have data showing the length of time (in ms) for further troubleshooting.
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* SAP HANA High Availability Cluster

### Installation

Download the binary from Releases (<https://github.com/rfparedes/hanacall-timer/releases/latest/download/hanacall-timer>) to `/usr/local/bin` on the server and run:

```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hanacall-timer
```

Start it

```sh
sudo hanacall-timer start --sidadm <SIDADM>
```

Check Status Anytime

```sh
hanacall-timer status
```

## Technical Details

* hanacall-timer will time two HANA interface calls. These calls are made exactly as they are from within the SAPHanaSR resource agents.
   1. systemReplicationStatus.py
   2. landscapeHostConfiguration.py
* When started, a systemd service and timer are created.  The timer is enabled and will run hanacall-timer every 60 seconds
* Only one instance of hanacall-timer will run at any given time. If HANA_CALL takes longer than 60 seconds, no additional calls will be made until the HANA_CALL's return
* When starting, the HANA <SIDADM> user needs to be specified as this is the user making the HANA_CALL
* The log includes command output, command return codes and timings logged to /var/log/hanacall-timer.log
* The output of the timings are also logged in csv format to /var/log/hanacall-timer.csv in the format:
  
  `RFC3339 date-time, systemReplicationStatus.py time (ms), landscapeHostConfiguration.py time (ms)`

As an example, you can see the HANA_CALL landscapeHostConfiguration timings increasing on this server from 293ms to a high of 32.097s:
```sh
hana11:~ # tail -f /var/log/hanacall-timer.csv
2021-03-27T19:57:45-04:00,297,293
2021-03-27T19:58:46-04:00,317,316
2021-03-27T19:59:46-04:00,373,373
2021-03-27T20:00:46-04:00,594,594
2021-03-27T20:01:47-04:00,421,420
2021-03-27T20:02:47-04:00,2375,2346
2021-03-27T20:03:48-04:00,3670,3639

2021-03-27T20:06:50-04:00,31271,31055
```

## Usage

### To start, run

```sh
sudo hanacall-timer start --sidadm <SIDADM>
```

### To stop, run

```sh
sudo hanacall-timer stop
```

### To see the current start/stop status of hanacall-timer, run

```sh
hanacall-timer status
```

## Build it yourself

* You'll need a go compiler installed

Clone it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rfparedes/hanacall-timer.git
```

Build it

```sh
cd hanacall-timer
go build -o hanacall-timer
```

Move it

```sh
mv hanacall-timer /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hanacall-timer
```

Start it

```sh
sudo hanacall start --sidadm <SIDADM>
```
